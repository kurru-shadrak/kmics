           <p> <span> </span>   This issue of DISHA is going to cross another milestone in the success story of KESHAV MEMORIAL
     INSTITUTE OF COMMERCE AND SCIENCES Whether it is from the point of view of addition of new Courses like B.Com Analytics 
     and BBA or the performance of the students in academics and the extra curricular activities, the progress is phenomenal.<br/><br/>

The Institute figured at 148th place at all India level in the field of Commerce and 161st in the fi Science, in the survey 
conducted by INDIA TODAY group. At the State level, the ranks are 7th and respectively. The positions are indeed a matter of pride.
 In the disciplines of Analytical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Mathematics, in Post graduate level, our students secured good ranks 
 at University level.<br/><br/>

Ours is a rare private institution where seats at Graduate level are totally filled, at a time when many private Degree and 
Post Graduate institutions are struggling without sufficient students. Our Institution has been sanctioned a NCC Unit for Boys and Girls by the Government of India in the year 2021.
<br/><br/>
The placement of students at Post Graduate and Under Graduate levels is indeed encouragingcompanies like TCS, WIPRO, GENPACT, INFOSYS, 
ICICI PRUDENTIAL, HGS HETRO DRUGS.REDDY LABS, and many more MNCs and Pharma companies, have recruited large number of our students.
 The feedback is that the companies are very much satisfied with the performance of our students.after recruitment. The growth of the 
 Society is evident from the fact that we got the approval from AICTE and other authorities for starting KESHAV MEMORIAL INSTITUTE 
 OF MANAGEMENT(KMIM) with effect from 2021.<br/><br/>

The upgradation of standards is a continuous process that would be possible only when the students and faculty make unrelenting efforts. The success story of a particular year does not spill over to the next year automatically Efforts are needed to excel our own performance in the previous year. I am confident that the dedicated faculty and the determined students will take institution to further heights in the years to come
