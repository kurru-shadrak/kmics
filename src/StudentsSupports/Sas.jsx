Education must award self-confidence and the courage to depend on one’s own strength. Today many students who are brilliant, hardworking and well organized are deprived of pursuing Higher Education due to lack of financial support. Keshav Memorial Education Society under “Support a Student” has come forward to encourage and extend a helping hand to highly meritorious and deserving students. SAS was introduced in the year 2017-2018 and equal importance is given to boys and girls.
